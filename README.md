# Nebula 1.0
### ⚠️ This current build of Nebula is NOT complete and its official release will be completely different from its current release.
Nebula is a fun project to help me understand sass more, alot of unnecessary scss styling throughout the theme, all compiled into one file. Have fun!

## Notice For contributors
Before contributing to this project, please look through LeafyLuigi's [Sulfide](https://github.com/LeafyLuigi/sulfide) as this is the backend for how Nebula keeps its classes updated and maintained, and every file uses this system. So it'd be good to get familiar with it.

## Credits
Nebula is greatly inspired by these projects to make Nebula what it is today.
