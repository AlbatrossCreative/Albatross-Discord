## Contribution
Before contributing to this project, please look through LeafyLuigi's [Sulfide](https://github.com/LeafyLuigi/sulfide) as this is the backend for how Nebula keeps its classes updated and maintained.

I recommend developing with Vencord as it is easier, however Vencord may disconnect sometimes.
